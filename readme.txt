This program is searching for specific data from ads in auta.bazos.sk 

1) Year the car was constructed: From 1995 - 2023
2) Car performance in kW
3) Driven kM

- App will load each webpage for aprox. 12 seconds. I would suggest downloading the data locally beforehand to speed up the program.
- The logic behind searching driven kilometers (km), kilowatts (kW), and years isn't perfect because Bazoz uses plain text, and users can add as many similar numbers as they want.
- If you want to search for bikes, just add logic to the pre-existing function in Flask
