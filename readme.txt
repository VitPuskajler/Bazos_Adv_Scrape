This program is searching for specific data from ads in auta.bazos.sk 

1) Year the car was constructed: From 1995 - 2023
2) Car performance in kW
3) Driven kM

- App will load each webpage for aprox. 12 seconds. I would suggest to download data locally ahead to speed up the program
- Logic behind searching driven km, kw, years isn't perfect because bazos is working with simple text and user can add as many similliar numbers as he wants
- If you want to search for bikes, just add logic in preexisting function in flask
